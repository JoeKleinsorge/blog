Hi, I'm Joey!

I am currently a Cloud Platform Automation Engineer at a Class 1 railroad in Jacksonville, FL. I primarily focus on designing and developing my company's hybrid cloud self-service automated solutions mostly using VMware's vRealize Suite: vRealize Automation and vRealize Orchestrator.

## Where else can you find me?
