## Me

Hey there, as you have already guessed, I'm Joe [Kleinsorge](https://www.joeykleinsorge.com/kleinsorge) and this is my site. Iâ€™m happiest when I am working with passionate and principled people on things that matter.

### Occupation

I started out racking and stacking servers in the data center, then began automating the deployment and management of those servers and fell in love with it. I then moved into virtualization and IT Operations automation for awhile. Eventually falling into the world of [DevOps](https://www.easyaslinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/download-715x1024.png) and have been there since.

### How to connect with me?

I have an open inbox policy. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk anything tech, mountain biking in the south east US, or just want to say hi.
