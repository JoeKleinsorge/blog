A coworker of mine once showed me a really cool python script he used to take notes in [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi). It really seemed to simplify and organize how he took notes and at the time I was still trying to figure out a better method than I currently had (OneNote is not fast). I decided to build upon his idea and try to develop it using my preferred tools ( PowerShell and Visual Studio Code). Anyways here is what I created and how I use it.

The Code
For those that want to just read the code themselves or who just want to jump into using it, here's the script:

## How I use it

I like taking notes but find that unorganized notes can be a bit of a mental burden instead of a useful helper. This system of note-taking is really basic in that most notes are titled by the day they were created. This helps keep them organized in the folder by date.

I store all my notes in a folder on my OneDrive, this allows me to access them from anywhere and makes sure that I won't lose them if my computer goes caput. In the script, I set the directory parameter to default to this folder so that the script will always create/ search for the notes there unless I specify otherwise.

When I just want to take a quick note of something, I can just run the script as-is and it will pop open the daily note in notepad.

Say I want to create a note about a specific topic, however. I Â can use the -name parameter to create a note with that name.

I can use that same parameter to open up a note that I specify.

I can use the -list parameter to list out all the notes I have in the directory.

One of my favorite uses of the script is the -search parameter, this will take the string input and do a pattern match against all the text files in the directory and bring back the exact path of the match to the line # as well as the other text on that line of the note.
