I get it my last name is a little long, somewhat difficult to pronounce, and fairly rare.

It's easy enough when you break it down though. My family's version of the pronunciation breaks it up into two parts; **Klein** ( like the clothing brand minus the Calvin) + **sorge** ( like storage without the t or a).

## Formal Definition

German:

Nickname for a carefree person, from Middle High German Klein ‘small’, ‘little’ + sorge ‘worry’, ‘concern’.Habitational name from Kleinsorge in the former East Prussia, named as a resort meaning ‘few worries’, ‘without a care’.

## TL;DR

It roughly translates to Hakuna Matata!
